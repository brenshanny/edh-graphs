"Penultimate Turn Cycle: Teysa nearly combo'd off, but wasn't able to stick a Cruel Celebrant due to 2 counterspells (1 for CC; 1 for animate dead), so he had to settle for 990,000 white spirit tokens.  Ended his turn with an Elesh Norn and T-Pro (Bye!).   Bren (Wort) has a magnificent Gruul storm turn, digging for an instant speed way to kill Alex on his upkeep when he phases back in from T-Pro.  Wort spends 20m chaining Escape to the wilds &Mana Geyser off conspire and U-Breach. Sticks a Purphy and starts to make tokens.  John T-Pro's out (Bye!).  Bub's dies to the Purpy.  So its literally just Wort and 2 phased out players (alex and john).  Wort continues digging; Finds an answer. Waits for upkeep. Alex untaps.  Wort Electrodominance's Alex's face for 8 and makes 3 tokens for free.  Alex exiles Purphy in reponse so the tokens don't deal the final 6 lethal dmg.  Alex goes to combat and swings 100 of his 998,997 white spirit tokens at Bren.  John untaps and phases back in from T-Pro. Alex holds priority to Swords the Linvala, Keeper of Silence who is shushing Alex's sac outlets (teysa & carrion feeder).  In response John casts Rakdos charm, doming Alex for 998,998 damage.
